Question-1: Add at least 3 Project features

Answer: The course registration project is done using React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Daisy UI. The attractive features of this project are:
-When the select button for each course is clicked, the course is added to the cart. The most interesting thing is that one course can be selected and added to the cart only once. If one course is selected more than once, then a toast is displayed.
-The total credit hour is, by default, 0. When a course is selected, the credit hour of that course is added to the total credit hour. But there is a condition that more than 20 credit hours are not allowed. One can select courses for up to 20 credit hours. If it is more than 20 credit hours, a toast is displayed.
-There is one credit hour remaining in the cart. By default, its value is 20 hours. There is a condition that the number of credit hours remaining should not be less than 0. When the value is 0, a toast is displayed.
-The price of the selected courses is added to the total price in the cart.
-Each card has a cover image of the course, course name, course details, price, and credit hour. There is a see more button to show more details about the courses.
